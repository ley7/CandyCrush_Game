1.The game will present you with a standard board of 9x9. In this game, there are 5 kinds of candies in total. You need to slide on the screen, the program will detect the start position and the end position when you slide, you could only switch two adjacent candies. Two adjacent candies can be switched if and only if they result in valid combination of three or more candies.

2.Each candy is 20 score. So you will earn 60 score for 3 candies elimination, 80 score for 4 candies elimination , 100 score for 5 candies elimination.

3.If you reaches 8000 score, then there will be be an alert dialog telling you you win! After you click OK, the program will be terminated

4.If there are no more possible moves on the board, there wil be an alert dialog telling you you lose. After you click OK, the program will be terminated

5.In the code, each function has a comment describing its functionality.

6.*************IMPOTMANT**************:
When you open this project, if you meet an loadng file error saying that:Cannot load module file 'savages_Assignment_2 master\savages_Assignment2.iml':File E:\savages_Assignment_2-master\savages_Assignment2.iml does not exist. You can just ignore it and continue. This loading file error is because our two android files have different names at first. So after we upload them in the github, we need to unify the file name. But it seems like there is still a wrong name file shouldn't be somewhere, but if it's there, actually it doesn't matter. You can see the error detail and click yes to remove that file. If you don't remove it, it's also OK. This error doesn't affect the program at all.

7.For the grader: Because we only have 5 kinds of candies, and the board relatively big. So after generating random candies, there can be some other eliminations at some other places. And because the game don't have an animation, you need to check very carefully whether the elimination is correct. We suggest you use a phone to take two pictures before and after your move. You could compare these two pictures to see whether the elimination is correct. Thank you.
